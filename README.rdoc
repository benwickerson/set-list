== Set-List

A quick and dirty little set-list management app for my band.  Should include
* ability to add tunes to a set-list

* sort the set list into a desired order

* add new tunes (inc PDF or image of sheet music)

* make notes both on the tune in general and/or gig-specific notes on each tune

* track rehersals with notes etc

* stats on popular tunes/times rehersed etc
